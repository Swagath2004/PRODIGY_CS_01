 ## My first task as intern in PRODIGY INFOTECH.

### Task about:

Creating a python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Allowing user to input a messsage and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.

### Caesar Cipher:

This program implements a simple Caesar Cipher algorithm in the Python programming language. The Caesar Cipher algorithm is used for the encryption and decryption of text or messages. In this algorithm, every letter of the text or message is shifted by a fixed number of positions defined by the user as the shift value.

### Features:

**Encryption:** Shifts every letter of the input text and converts the entire text into an encrypted form based on the defined shift value.

**Decryption:** Reverses the encrypted text back to the original text or message using the shift value.

### Usage:

1.Execute the Python script and follow the prompts.

2.User inputs:
* Choice of encryption or decryption.
* User-defined custom message or text.
* User-defined shift value.
